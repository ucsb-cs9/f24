     student ID when turning in your exam
* Final exam will be cummulative

    * True / False (if false, briefly explain why)
    * Short answer
        * Briefly describe / state / define ...
    * Given some code, write the output
    * Write code satisfying a certain specification
    * Given some algorithm we covered in class, fill in the
    blank to make it work
    * Draw diagrams
    * Multiple choice
